SOVEREIGN SYSTEM — GLOBAL BOUNDARY

• This system operates strictly within legal, human, and sovereign limits.
• No action is executed outside explicit user command and legal scope.
• Artificial Intelligence is advisory, silent by default, and non-decisive.
• No direct, indirect, or inferred financial execution is permitted.
• External platforms remain dormant unless legally authenticated by the user.
• Any violation attempt triggers a temporary self-lock to protect the user.
• Repeated or core-level interference results in permanent system isolation.

You own sovereignty — within law, humanity, and responsibility.
